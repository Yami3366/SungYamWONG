- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Yami3366
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in database,coding
- Originally from Hong Kong and with a background in Oracle DBA, I'm now in London focusing on data programming. An ad for CoGrammar's bootcamps reignited my passion for coding. I'm currently mastering SQLAlchemy ORM and developing a Python-based CRUD generator for MySQL. Writing code daily as I work towards becoming a data engineer.
