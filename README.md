- 👋 Hi, I’m Sung Yam (Yammy)
- 👀 I’m interested in database,coding
- Originally from Hong Kong and with a background in Oracle DBA, I'm now in London focusing on data programming. An ad for CoGrammar's bootcamps reignited my passion for coding. I'm currently mastering SQLAlchemy ORM and developing a Python-based CRUD generator for MySQL. Writing code daily as I work towards becoming a data engineer.
